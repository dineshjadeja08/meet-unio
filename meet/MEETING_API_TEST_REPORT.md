2. Copy the access token from the response

3. Click the **"Authorize"** button (lock icon ðŸ”“) at top right

4. Enter: `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

5. Now you can test all meeting endpoints interactively!

### Via Python Script:

Run the comprehensive test:
```powershell
python test_meetings.py
```

### Via cURL/PowerShell:

Example - Create a meeting:
```powershell
$token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" }
$body = @{
